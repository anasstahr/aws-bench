"""Plugin-capable Claude Code agent for aws-bench.

Extends Harbor's ``claude-code`` agent so a headless ``claude --print`` run can
install Claude Code plugins into its per-trial config directory before the task
runs. A plugin bundles MCP servers and skills together, so installing one makes
both available to the agent.

Marketplaces and plugins are supplied as constructor kwargs, so they flow from
``--ak`` on the run CLI::

    -a claude-code \
      --ak marketplaces='["anthropics/claude-plugins-official"]' \
      --ak plugins='["aws-core@claude-plugins-official"]'

With no ``plugins``, no plugin install runs.
